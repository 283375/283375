## ⚡ Fun facts

- This weird username: When I first tried to join a Minecraft server back in 2014, I was using an unofficial Minecraft launcher with the username "jack". However, That username was already taken in the server. So, I generated a random number, `283375`, and have been using it as my username for various platforms ever since.
